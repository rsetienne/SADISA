Description: Computes the probability of a set of species abundances of a single or multiple samples of individuals with one or more guilds under a mainland-island model. One must specify the mainland (metacommunity) model and the island (local) community model. It assumes that species fluctuate independently. The package also contains functions to simulate under this model. See Haegeman, B. & R.S. Etienne (2017). A general sampling formula for community structure data.
